# Exploratory-Analysis-of-Biomechanical-Data
This repo is an analysis of lower half biomechanics. It goes through ground reaction forces and their relationship with pitch speed. The analysis ends with commentary about the analysis and some actionables for athletes that want to increase pitch speed.

The jupyter notebook is in the main.ipynb file. Download the needed dependencies to run the notebook by running the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Thank you and enjoy!
