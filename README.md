# Exploratory-Analysis-of-Biomechanical-Data
This repo is an analysis of the lower half biomechanics. It goes through ground reaction forces and their relationship on pitch speed, as well as relationships that show increases in ground reaction forces. The analysis ends with commentary about the analysis and some actionables for athletes that want to increase pitch speed.
